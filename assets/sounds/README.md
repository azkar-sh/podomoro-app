# Sound Assets

This directory should contain:

- `ding.mp3` - A notification sound for timer completion

You can add your own notification sound file here, or use a simple ding sound from a royalty-free source.

The sound should be:

- Short (1-2 seconds)
- Pleasant and not jarring
- Compatible with both iOS and Android
- MP3 format for best compatibility

Example sources for notification sounds:

- freesound.org
- zapsplat.com (free account)
- Or record your own simple bell/ding sound
